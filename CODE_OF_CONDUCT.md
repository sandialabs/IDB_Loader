# Contributor Code of Conduct


## Standards

* Be polite
* Don't destroy other people's code


## Maintener Responsibilities

Project maintainers decide what polite and destroying code
mean.

Project maintainers have the right to remove any contributions
that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct. 
Mainteners also can ban contributors who do not adhere to the standards.


## Reporting

Report bad behavior via email to opensource@sandia.gov. The subject line should
include IDB Behavior. Maintainers will investigate as far as they can and 
respond as well as they can.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith will be summarily dealt with.
