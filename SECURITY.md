# Reporting Security Issues


 **Please do not file an issue via the issue tracker**, we'd prefer to avoid publishing security problem details until after we have a fix in place. 

If you find a security problem in the IDB Data Loader, please report it via email to [opensource@sandia.gov](mailto:opensource@sandia.gov). Please include the words "[IDB SECURITY]" in the subject line. 

We will do our best to fix or find a work-around for the problem. As part of the fix process, we might ask for more details about the problem.
